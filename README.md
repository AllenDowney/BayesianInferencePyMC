# Bayesian Inference with PyMC

This repository contains slides and Jupyter notebooks for a workshop on Bayesian inference using PyMC.

[The slides for the workshop are available as a Google doc](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRfzvjPnyBevd1VBt8yxwP23xuddrcYgu1mYOsTE9o_ViWJqoxWMhzgcw-FPhfeeobEbXYoeJvsPuQ-/pub).

For each of the notebooks below, you have three options: 

1. If you are participating in the workshop, run the first version of the notebook, which has space for you to work on examples and exercises.
2. If you just want to run the code, use the second version of the notebook, which has solutions.
3. If you just want to read the code, use the third link to view the notebook on NBViewer. 

If you run the notebook on Colab, you'll be able to run the code, do the exercises, and save your modified version of the notebook in a Google Drive (if you have one).
